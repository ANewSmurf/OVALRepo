    <description>Multiple use-after-free issues were discovered in Blink. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,
or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render
process. (&lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3178"&gt;CVE-2014-3178&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3190"&gt;CVE-2014-3190&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3191"&gt;CVE-2014-3191&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3192"&gt;CVE-2014-3192&lt;/a&gt;)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of
service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (&lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3179"&gt;CVE-2014-3179&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3200"&gt;CVE-2014-3200&lt;/a&gt;)

It was discovered that Chromium did not properly handle the interaction of
IPC and V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (&lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3188"&gt;CVE-2014-3188&lt;/a&gt;)

A use-after-free was discovered in the web workers implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,
an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service
via applicatin crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking the program. (&lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3194"&gt;CVE-2014-3194&lt;/a&gt;)

It was discovered that V8 did not correctly handle Javascript heap
allocations in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
steal sensitive information. (&lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3195"&gt;CVE-2014-3195&lt;/a&gt;)

It was discovered that Blink did not properly provide substitute data for
pages blocked by the XSS auditor. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafter website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
steal sensitive information. (&lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3197"&gt;CVE-2014-3197&lt;/a&gt;)

It was discovered that the wrap function for Event&amp;#39;s in the V8 bindings
in Blink produced an erroneous result in some circumstances. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service by stopping a worker
process that was handling an Event object. (&lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3199"&gt;CVE-2014-3199&lt;/a&gt;)

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via
renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
sandboxed render process. (&lt;a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7967"&gt;CVE-2014-7967&lt;/a&gt;)</description>

    <description>
										      Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 68 and Firefox ESR 68. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-11735)
										      The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the updates directory, allowing for the replacement of local files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access. Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected. (CVE-2019-11736)
										      If a Content Security Policy (CSP) directive is defined that uses a hash-based source that takes the empty string as input, execution of any javascript: URIs will be allowed. This could allow for malicious JavaScript content to be run, bypassing CSP permissions. (CVE-2019-11738)
										      The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an http: URL rather than secure https: they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored. (CVE-2019-11747)
										      WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use. (CVE-2019-11748)
										      A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the getUserMedia API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users. (CVE-2019-11749)
										      A type confusion vulnerability exists in Spidermonkey, which results in a non-exploitable crash. (CVE-2019-11750)
										      Logging-related command line parameters are not properly sanitized when Firefox is launched by another program, such as when a user clicks on malicious links in a chat application. This can be used to write a log file to an arbitrary location such as the Windows 'Startup' folder. *Note: this issue only affects Firefox on Windows operating systems. (CVE-2019-11751)
